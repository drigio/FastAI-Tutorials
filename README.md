# FastAI-Tutorials

Just my repo for all the [FastAI](https://course.fast.ai/) coursework. It has all the extra coursework for each lesson. I have been using [**Google's colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/) as my primary VPS. So all the codes used in the notebooks will mostly reflect colab. I have been trying to do almost all the things in Google's colab. However if anything is done without using the platform, it will be specifically mentioned in the notebooks.

Lessons are grouped as folders. Each lesson has jupyter notebooks and the scripts (if any) used in those notebooks.
